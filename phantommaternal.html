                    <h1>Phantom Maternal (2024)</h1>
                    <h2>An interactive, hybrid novel which utilises the power of fictive text and 3D spaces in sequence
                        to
                        bring a story to life. This project scored a first (80%)</h2>
                    <p>Created for my Disseration Project and built within Unity Game Engine, Phantom Maternal uses 5
                        chapters: 1, 3 &amp; 5 in written text and 2 &amp; 4 as interactive 3D representations, to
                        diversify the user&#39;s experiene and supplement the story with a multimedia approach.</p>
                    <p>The story flows linearly, the 3D chapters giving the user spacial context and atmosphere while
                        still enabling them to use their imagination as the story content is rooted in its visuals. The
                        use of both traditional and modern storytelling aims to heighten the user&#39;s immersion and
                        introduce demographics to a form they possibly never entertained. This project ambitiously aims
                        to bridge the gap between video game and novel in a literal approach, realised in a single
                        digital format.</p>

                <h2>Story Blurb</h2>
                <p>George is a responsible young lad at the mere age of ten, but he didn&#39;t anticipate having to
                    travel cross-country solo for the first time today. It was an accident of course! He could barely
                    make out which carriage his mother was in before the train started to roll away from the platform.
                    He knew that travelling for the first time by himself is bound to be daunting, but is it supposed to
                    be this creepy? The small station, the crackling speakers, the frail passengers, not to mention his
                    new stoic, red-haired caretaker Francie. And what about this train? It&#39;s glorious shining metal
                    facade now seems like an illusion from the interior of cracked wallpaper and institutionalsied
                    decor. But what&#39;s this? Something changed, something… obvious. Was the train always going this
                    fast? Were the chairs always made of dark garish wood? And the walls… the walls are different. And
                    over there was something in the field just now… it felt dark and intruding, garish and
                    anticipanting. George didn&#39;t like this one bit. And now where on earth is Francie?</p>
