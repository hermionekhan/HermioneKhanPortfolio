                <h2>Phantom Maternal: The Text</h2>
                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>I started writing this piece for my Dissertation project at the end of December 2023 and from the initial draft, to the final version submitted in May 2024, I gained the opportuity to not only create and implement a narrative into a virtual space, but also evolve the story through many iterations. The text itself is comprised of three written chapters (1, 3, 5) and two planned virtual chapters (2, 4) to make the story a whole. When writing the narrative I decided to block out these virtual chapters using basic notes on interaction and level design, taking it further to storyboard the virtual chapters for ease of implementation.</p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>When faced with completing a story for a project as important as my Dissertation, I was at a loss. I decided to focus on what story would be displayed well in the multi-media format I was suggesting, and thought about what works well in similar product types such as visual novels and narrative-heavy triple A games. While these thoughts helped me to narrow down genre, length and structure, it was looking at storytelling tropes as a whole that enabled me to decide on content. I thought a horror-mystery would be the most effective example of depicting how my product could work, considering horror, its origins and its selling points. I very nearly went for a vampirish, haunted mansion type, and it wasn't until I watched the Netflix documentary on the Luna Park Ghost Train fire, that I decided to use one of horror's most celebrated tropes: Ghost Trains.</p>
                <p>By making my main character a young child, I had a large range of fears and insecurities that I could play off. To make these emotional impacts relatable to the reader, I decided to pick a theme that most humans could resonate with: leaving the nest. The merriment of a lost child is known to writers all around the world, and to make it unique to this story, I paired that feeling of fear and abandonement with the horror genre. The aim was to make the reader/user question whether the events of the story were real, or simply the figment of our young protagonist's mind in his air of isolation and anxiety about travelling alone for the first time.</p>

            <h2>Blurb</h2>
            <p>George is a responsible young lad at the mere age of ten, but he didn&#39;t anticipate having to
                travel cross-country solo for the first time today. It was an accident of course! He could barely
                make out which carriage his mother was in before the train started to roll away from the platform.
                He knew that travelling for the first time by himself is bound to be daunting, but is it supposed to
                be this creepy? The small station, the crackling speakers, the frail passengers, not to mention his
                new stoic, red-haired caretaker Francie. And what about this train? It&#39;s glorious shining metal
                facade now seems like an illusion from the interior of cracked wallpaper and institutionalsied
                decor. But what&#39;s this? Something changed, something… obvious. Was the train always going this
                fast? Were the chairs always made of dark garish wood? And the walls… the walls are different. And
                over there was something in the field just now… it felt dark and intruding, garish and
                anticipanting. George didn&#39;t like this one bit. And now where on earth is Francie?</p>
