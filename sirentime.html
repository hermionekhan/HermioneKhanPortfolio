                    <h1>Siren Time (2022)</h1>
                    <h2>A short horror game where the user must evade the monster in the time given, or perish at its hand. Scored a high second (67%)</h2>
                    <p>Made for my first year module 'Media Production For Interactive Environments', Siren Time was a leap into my first experience of Game Development and Design. Despite its amateruish charm, the short game has a strong grasp of design fundamentals: environment, narratology, atmosphere. systems and interactions. Its strengths lie in the audio engineering, animation and narrative design which all tailor towards the research and context put into the piece.</p>
                    <p>The learning curve for this project was extremely steep, and while it introduced me to the world of Game Development, it also enabled me to pursue a creative identity that I had never explored before. I am now a fan of the horror-genre as a result and continue to make beta games that push tension, atmosphere and story above all else.</p>

                <h2>Context &amp; Research</h2>
                <p>This project includes the Creepypasta (internet urban legend) Siren Head; a tall, skeletal figure with an echoing siren. This online urban legend reached popularity in 2020, and it's horror-elements seemed to fit a video game well: the echoing siren could be used a proximity feature, building atmosphere and tension. A clocktower is also featured to include a physical representation for the time limit the player needs to survive in. The tower itself is insired by an old clocktower on the Seacroft Estate near Leeds, UK. When I first saw this tower it was dark, cold and a silent night. I was respectfully chilled and thought it would be good to insert real-life inspiration into the game.</p>
