                <p class="about-para">Hi! My name is Hermione Khan, I am 21 years old, my
                    pronouns are she/her and my MBTI is ENTP. My friends percieve me as welcoming, resillient and creatively innovative (according to a recent Instagram poll) and while they are correct, I
                    have a few more things to add: I am idealistic, driven and a perfectionist.
                    While these words can have double edges, I prefer to use my traits and passions to my
                    advantage!</p>
                <p class="about-para">From a young age I have travelled: From overlanding in Northern
                    Africa to backpacking through South-East Asia, I have visited a broad range of cultures, biomes,
                    societies, ecosystems and cities that have informed my passion for exploration. This expanded my
                    individualism, self-sufficiency and ability to mediate and
                    empathise with multiple perspectives.</p>
                <p class="about-para">I am happy, hopeful and hardworking. I strive to further understand what's in
                    front of me, and even seek out what's far away. If I work for you, I will use every part of my
                    character to achieve a result that is not
                    one-sided, but multi-dimensional in its aim!</p>

                <h2 class="website-title">This Website</h2>
                <p class="about-para">This website is completely hardcoded, made to showcase my work in a format of my
                    creative ideals making it part of the portfolio!</p>
                <p class="about-para">The logo featured at
                    the top was made in Blender and converted into a .gif format for ease of
                    use. Many of the elements in this website were informed by my design style,
                    which includes dynamic, clean and metallic representations. As I have the desire for
                    perfection, this website will probably change and be altered many, many times and never conclude.
                    Tune in for its evolution!</p>
