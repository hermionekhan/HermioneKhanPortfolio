        <p class="about-para">Welcome to Hermione Khan's Portfolio Website. Feel free to explore all sections and use the information displayed on the contact page for any enquiries. Enjoy your time here!</p>
        <p class="about-para">'The Park' showcases visual and written recreational work, inspired by topics I am passionate about such as fashion, photography, music and advertisement. 'Interactive Media' showcases my favourite projects and assignments from my degree at The University Of York.</p>
        <h2 class="website-title">About This Website</h2>
        <p class="about-para">This website is completely hardcoded, made to showcase my work in a format and design of my creative ideals. In a way, this website is part of the portfolio! The logo featured at the top was made in blender (including the material) and converted into a gif format for ease of use, it looks pretty cool, right? Many elements of this website were informed by my design style, in which I prefer clean, dynamic and metallic representations. As I have the *unfortunate* desire for perfection, this website will probably change and be altered many, many times and never conclude. Tune in for its evolution!</p>
        <p class="about-para">Special mentions to Canva, Font Space and Pinterest for their support in getting cool fonts, inspiration and keeping the image count low.</p>
