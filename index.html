            passionate about such as fashion, photography, music and advertisement.
            'The Lounge' features written and miscellaneous recreational work, inspired by
            music, social topics and external stimuli.
            'Interactive Media' showcases my favourite projects and assignments from my degree
            at The University Of York.</p>

                <p class="about-para">Hello! If you don't know me, my name is Hermione Khan, I am 21 years old, my
                    pronouns are she/her and my MBTI is ENTP. My friends percieve me as _ and while they are (mostly)
                    correct, I have a few more things to add: I am idealistic, driven, obsessive, a perfectionist, and
                    while these words have double edges, I prefer to use my traits, flaws and passions all to my
                    advantage. If I work for you, I will use every part of my character to achieve a result that is not
                    one-sided, but multi-dimensional in its aim.</p>
                <p class="about-para">I believe that character is shaped through experiences and soul, here are a few
                    that have helped to mould mine: from a young age I have travelled, from overlanding in Northern
                    Africa to backpacking through South-East Asia, I have visited a broad range of cultures, biomes,
                    societies, ecosystems and cities that have informed my passion for exploration. I am also a child of
                    divorce, and while the negative repurcussions are the most noticed by society, I take positivity
                    from the situation through my expanded individualism, self-sufficiency and ability to mediate and
                    empathise with multiple perspectives.</p>
                <p class="about-para">I am happy, hopeful and hardworking. I strive to further understand what's in
                    front of me, and even seek out what's far away. I would add more, but you're just going to have to
                    get to know me yourself!</p>

                <h2 class="website-title">This Website</h2>
                <p class="about-para">This website is completely hardcoded, made to showcase my work in a format and
                    design of my creative ideals. In a way, this website is part of the portfolio! The logo featured at
                    the top was made in blender (including the material) and converted into a gif format for ease of
                    use, it looks pretty cool, right? Many elements of this website were informed by my design style, in
                    which I prefer clean, dynamic and metallic representations. As I have the *unfortunate* desire for
                    perfection, this website will probably change and be altered many, many times and never conclude.
                    Tune in for its evolution!</p>
