                        <span>'Jordan Is Pitiful' is a short piece of social fiction. Written intially in 2023 while I
                            was on holiday in Thailand and later continued in summer 2024, it follows a situation
                            concerning main character 'Jordan' and a conversation he has with himself while being
                            surrounded by family at an all-inclusive resort. As well as the fictive text, my own
                            analysis and thoughts on the piece are included as commentary.</span>

                        <span>'Phantom Maternal: The Text' is the raw narrative for my Dissertation Project, in which
                            fictive text and virtual environments are used in conjunction to create a symbiotic and
                            multi-media story. The narrative concerns a ten-year old boy named George who becomes separated with his mother at a small-town train station, only to wind up on a connection that, despite bringing him home in the end, takes him on a journey full of fear, confusion and mystery.</span>
