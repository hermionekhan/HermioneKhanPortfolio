                    <h1>The King&#39;s Meadow (2023)</h1>
                    <h2>An immersive and interactive personality quiz which features a branching narrative structure and a beautiful environment design, encompassed using a website and Unity WebGL to maximise user experience and accessibility. This project scored a first (71%).</h2>
                    <p>Created for a large Group Project and built using Unity Game Engine and Twine, The King&#39;s Meadow uses a branching narrative to ask the user questions and lead them down a narrative designed by their own choices. As they venture down the majestic sunset forest&#39;s paths, they are faced with moral choices of the scenarios, conceptualised through the story of an ancient kingdom and its succesors. The virtual environment brings to life the story realised by the user: As they choose their answers, the environment reflects the story they curate through certain animals, flowers and path shape. This experience, delivered through a website, gives the user a personality type depicted by flower language, using the Myers-Briggs personality system as a foundation.</p>

                <h2>Group Role &amp; Responsibillities</h2>
                <p>In this Group Project, my main role was Environment Design. This includes building the environment in Unity, sourcing models and assets, confguring the lighting settings and designing the pathways to hold the narrative. I also had the role of Project Lead, which included directing and delegating group member workload, creating accessible lines of communication within the group and helping with administrative tasks. Furthermore, I aided in implementing the branching narrative into Unity and in ideating the narrative concept of the experience.</p>
                <p>From working on this project, I learnt what qualities it takes to lead a group of talented people while working on development yourself at the same time. This experience gave me the opportunity to learn how to multitask and prioritise different sides of project development while ensuring forward progress on a timeline. It also taught me skills in how to effectively communicate ideas and collaborate with other creative individuals, as well as how to build a positive working atmosphere within a team. We overcame many stressful problems thanks to our hopeful and positive attitude, as well as our organisation in keeping the project on track. I want to thank my group members for being kind and well-rounded individuals that faced their obstacles head-on and nurtured team spirit with me.</p>
