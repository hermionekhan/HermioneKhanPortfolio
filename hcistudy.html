                    <h2>How Do Different Types Of Online Media Forms Influence Momentary
                        Emotion In Response To Influencer Content? This study scored a first (88%)</h2>
                    <p>This experiment studied how different types of online media forms influence momentary
                        emotion in response to influencer content. In a 1 X 3 between-participants design, a
                        convenience sample of 36 university students (27 female, 8 male, 1 non-binary) was equally
                        randomised into three media form conditions: long-form, short-form and audio-form. They
                        were asked to record their momentary emotion regarding change (using an Affect Grid) and
                        intensity (using a Positive And Negative Affect Schedule). Both quantitative results were not
                        confident in proving that there is an influence from the type of online media form to
                        momentary emotion (overall alpha level was 0.05), however, the qualitative analysis provides
                        insight into how we can use this study moving forward in the research area of influencer
                        content on user emotions.</p>
                    <p>I greatly enjoyed performing this HCI study as I was able to research a topic of interest to me: how influencer content on social media affects users. Furthermore, I learnt fundamental skills of performing User Research, gathering statistical data and running a research project. From doing this, I realised that I have a talent for understanding and forming conclusions based on data gathering.</p>
