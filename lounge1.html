                <h2>Jordan Is Pitiful</h2>
                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>I started writing this piece in 2023 when I was on holiday in Thailand and I didn't know it at the
                    time but what I was writing was very critical, hypocritical and unresolved. Despite not having the
                    worries which the main character Jordan presents at the time, I was almost projecting and
                    anticipating what worries I would have in the next stage of my life, which coincidentally is now. I
                    don't think I knew that what I was writing then, would resonate so much with me now, and that is the
                    power that I wanted to convey when continuing this story in the present 2024.</p>
                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>Jordan is sour and his narrative voice is very sarcastic, so I wanted to use his inner dialogue
                    to show his change in mindset and ultimate realisation of his situation: yes, he's unemployed and
                    isn't valued in his career world, but for him to reflect on this and remove his personal opinions from the
                    trajectory of his unemployment is what I wanted Jordan to realise. Through speaking with his family, who he seemingly
                    looks down upon and regards as clueless when it comes to digital expertise, I wanted Jordan to
                    humble himself, in that he has no right to belittle his family just because they don't understand
                    his situation as he does. It's a classic take on arrogance through rejection, but
                    within the early career context. Despite unknowingly projecting my irrational anxiety into the
                    character at first, the values and commentary Jordan takes is more like an evil reflection of
                    graduating media students. If you wanted a moral it's this: rejection doesn't give you the right to be a [redacted]</p>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Jordan is unemployed. He has been for over a year since graduating. Is this his fault? No! Of course not!
                And them, his family, they just don't understand what he's going through. They couldn't understand how
                difficult it is navigating an early career in the digital industries. And what's more, they keep pushing
                his limits, asking stupid questions which only push him further into the oblivion of annoyance. What?
                What did you say? Oh, where's Jordan right now? He's over there by the pool with cousin Roy. What's
                that? Is he okay? Well... no, I think he's having to tell his family again how hard it is to be him. Oh,
                you think he's going to realise? Of course not, he's a hypocrite after all.</p>
