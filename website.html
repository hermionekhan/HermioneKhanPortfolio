                            <p>Introducing a concept and branding to a portfolio? Others have done it, we are sure of that... but this isn't just a concept, it's a peek into a world.</p>
                            <p>A world full of war, carved into a metal so thick and shimmering that it's scars shine brighter than the surface. Through the endless tension, comes a balance made of three...</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="first">First, 'The Six', a symbol so unordained that it draws power from the unknown and untapped. It depicts a sort of focus, in a state of overwhelming inspiration, to liquify time and create a continuium of lucid space. It came from nowhere, and had no constant place among the Sea... until it found the other two.</p>
                            <p class="second">Second, 'Synergetic', a distinguished element that embodies harmony and bridges skill with passion, forming a tightly woven, flexible thread at the center with razor sharp coating fortifying the outside. Untarnished, it remains a cornerstone of the Sea and without it's binding strength, the three could not exist to each other without falling into dominion.</p>
                            <p class="third">Third, and last, there is 'EGO'. Now, EGO isn't like the others, it's... a power that sides with sentience and tries to deny reason. Fractured between the conciouses, EGO  balances between feasibility and unrestrained desire, constantly hungering as an awake soul yet restricted by its place among the three. Left unkept, EGO can start to dysfunction and evolve, turning shards into puzzle pieces into atomic structure. It changes and responds, and requires the power of the other two to do so.</p>
