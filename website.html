                            <p>Introducing a concept and branding to a portfolio? Others have done it, I'm sure of that... but this isn't just a concept, it's a micro-universe.</p>
                            <p>A small space filled with war, struggle carved into a metal so thick and shimmering that its scars shine brighter than its surface. Through the endless tension, comes a balance made of a mere three...</p>
                        </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="website-bottom">
                                <div class="website-item">
                            <p>First, 'The Six', a symbol so unordained that it draws power from the unknown and untapped. It depicts a sort of focus, in a state of overwhelming inspiration, to liquify time and create a continuium of lucid space. It came from nowhere, and had no constant place among the sea of this micro-universe... until it found the other two.</p>
                        </div>
                            <div class="website-item">
                            <img src="CSS/Assets/thesix.gif">
                        </div>
                        <div class="website-item">
                                <img src="CSS/Assets/synergetic.gif">
                            </div>
                        <div class="website-item">
                            <p>Second, 'Synergetic', a distinguished state that embodies harmony and bridges skill with passion. Its energy structure forms a tightly woven, flexible thread at the center with razor sharp coating that fortifies the outside. Untarnished, it remains a cornerstone of the micro-universe and without it's binding strength, the three could not exist to each other without falling into dominion.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="website item">
                            <p>Third, there is 'Ego'. Now, Ego isn't like the others, it's a... power that sides with sentience and tries to deny all reason. Fractured between the conciouses, Ego  balances between feasibility and unrestrained desire, constantly hungering as an awake soul yet restricted by its place among the three. Left unkept, Ego can start to dysfunction and evolve, turning shards of greed into puzzle pieces of action and this action into atomic reactions. It changes and responds, and requires the power of the other two to do so under the circumstances of it surfacing.</p>
