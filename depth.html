                    <h1>Depth (2023)</h1>
                    <h2>An immersive virtual space, built on contextual mystery and curated audio and lighting. Acts as
                        a sample of a larger video game context. This project scored a first (73%).</h2>
                    <p>Created for an Advanced 3D Production module and built using Unity Game Engine, Depth aims to
                        situate a rich virtual environment and provide atmosphere for a wider narrative. With all models
                        created in Blender, and custom materials designed in Adobe Photoshop, the environment within
                        Depth reflects a recently abandoned deep-sea lab. The user is granted contextual clues within
                        the environment&#39;s design such as promotional banners for the lab&#39;s company
                        &#39;DEPTH&#39; and the state of emergency the lab has been left in: flashing alarms, warning
                        hollograms and not to mention the looming sea-creature seen in the distance.</p>

                <h2>World Building &amp; Context</h2>
                <p>The dep-sea exploration company &#39;DEPTH&#39; owns multiple off-grid labs situated in the South
                    Pacific Ocean. The exact location of these labs are unknown, and the only way to access them is by
                    undisclosed access points in shallow areas of the coast. DEPTH deny all allegations of these
                    labs&#39; existence, but their multiple personnel damage claim enquiries have alerted the
                    world&#39;s authorities that something is amiss in this tightly guarded corporation. The environment
                    created depicts the scenario of an agent who has recently infiltrated one of DEPTH&#39;s Pacific
                    labs, only to discover complete abandonement upon arrival. From the scene, the lab is only recently
                    abadoned, with the alarms and evacuation call still reverberrating on the thick glass walls. As the
                    agent, now player, explores the space, they realise that the lab is researching an elusive subject,
                    depicted through frequeny readings, CCTV footage and a range of measurement tools to create a sense
                    of sophistication and confusion. The various company banners depict slogans and propaganda to give
                    the player a sense of the company&#39;s control and influence over their employees. Because the
                    experience has no defining end, the player is given a sense of entrapment and isolation which could
                    possibly be explored in future scenarios.</p>
